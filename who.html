		<h2 class="anim"><a name="stallman">Richard Stallman</a></h2>
		<img class="anim" src="images/stallman.jpg" alt="Richard Stallman in 2014">
		<p class="anim">Richard Matthew Stallman was born on March 16, 1953. He excelled in mathematics as a high school student and began studying at Harvard in 1970. At the end of his first year, he regularly programmed in the MIT AI Lab. He received a bachelor's degree in physics in 1974, before moving to MIT as a fulltime graduate student and published an AI truth maintenance system.</p>
		<h3 class="anim"><a name="fsf">Free Software Foundation and GNU</a></h3>
		<p class="anim">As the '70s came to a close, "hacker culture" began to split off and most manufacturers stopped posting their source code and made their programs proprietary. Stallman saw this as a risk to user's privacy, so in 1985 he founded the Free Software Foundation to support the distribution of free software and the activism of the free software movement, mainly revolving around the GNU operating system which he announced two years prior.</p>

		<h2 class="anim"><a name="torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a></h2>
		<img class="anim" src="images/torvalds.jpg" alt="Linus Torvalds in 2002">
		<p class="anim">Linus Benedict Torvalds was born on December 28, 1969. Whilst attending the University of Helsinki studying computing science, he began Linux as a hobby project and licensed it under the GNU General Public Licence v2. Since graduating in 1996, he has worked at Transmeta from 1997 to 2003. After that, he began working at the Open Soure Development Labs, which merged with the Free Standards Group to form the Linux Foundation which he has worked at since.</p>
