		<h1 class="anim"><a name="gnu">Why were the GNU operating system and Linux kernel created?</a></h1>

		<h2 class="anim"><a name="opensource">GNU (recursively, GNU's Not Unix)</a></h2>

		<h3 class="anim"><a name="freedom">Open Source</a></h3>
		<p class="anim">At the time, many operating systems (like DOS) were proprietary. This means that you cannot inspect the code and see what it does. Richard Stallman set out to change this, and began work on GNU in 1983. Stallman believed that all computer users should be able to see exactly what their software is doing, which operating systems like DOS did not offer. GNU offers a free and open source Unix-like environment.</p>
		<h3 class="anim"><a name="linux">Freedom</a></h3>
		<p class="anim">GNU, according to Stallman and other open source proponents, is the only way to protect your privacy and thus freedom when using a PC. This is due to the licensing GNU is under, which is the GPL (GNU General Public License). This prevents any program using code from a GPL-licensed program from using a license that isn't GPL, thus ensuring all subsequent software packages are also open source.</p>

		<h2 class="anim"><a name="project">Linux</a></h2>
		<h3 class="anim"><a name="integration">Simple Project</a></h3>
		<p class="anim">The Linux kernel started out as a project by Linus Torvalds to learn the functions of the Intel 80386, namely task switching. He ported the bash shell and the GCC (GNU C Compiler) and in April 1991 announced its creation on the MINIX usenet forums. From then on, more features were implemented and in September 1991 version 0.01 was released.</p>
  
		<h2 class="anim"><a name="video">Integration</a></h2>
		<p class="anim">The two pieces of software were integrated in 1992, with GNU being the portion that the user interfaces with and Linux being the software that interacts with the computer hardware.</p>
